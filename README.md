# AI Usage
Used GhatGPT to help me debug and for ideation at the beginning when deciding what I should do for a categories and history page / if I should even do them

# Improvements Over Time
Something I would want to do in the future with this is definitely improve the stylistic choices. I originally decided to go with a glassy early2000s / Frutiger Aero aesthetic, and i would want to embrace that further. I would also want to fully flesh out an AI backend to make it more intuitive for the user. 

# Assumptions Made
Because of the time constraints, I was a bit limited in theming, so it's pretty minimal, but cute. The component and code snippets are both hardcoded templates, so I had to assume that this would be further developed before production

# Approach and Technical Choices
For my technical choices, I decede to go with react as my framework because it is somewhat an industry standard, and i am the most familiar with React as a framework. For navigation with github pages, react router was necessary because of the inability to host dynamic routing; also, I used hashrouter so that all the files are recognized in a static file structure. A lot of what I did is pretty hard-coded; I imported sme nova styles components, and instead of using an AI backend, everything is hard coded with an array of components that is being imported. The logic currently to map everything is also just keyword-search based.
